## Build

```sh
ANDROID_NDK_HOME=$ANDROID_NDK_ROOT sh scripts/build_android.sh
```

| Output | Content |
|---|---|
| `zig-out/android/jniLibs/<abi>/libzeptun.so` | engine, ready for `src/main/jniLibs` |
| `zig-out/android/prebuilt/<abi>/libzeptun.a` | static library the NDK build links |
| `zig-out/android/jniLibs/<abi>/libzeptun-jni.so` | JNI bridge, built by `ndk-build` |

ABIs are `armeabi-v7a`, `arm64-v8a`, `x86` and `x86_64`. Load segments are aligned to 16 KB, which Android 15 and later require. `Application.mk` sets `APP_PLATFORM := android-24`; change it there if you support older devices.

Without the NDK the script still produces the Zig libraries, which is all an application needs if it calls the [C API](C-API) directly.

## Command line on a rooted device

`zig build -Dtarget=aarch64-linux-android -Doptimize=ReleaseFast` also produces the `zeptun` and `zeptun-bench` executables as static binaries, which is the quickest way to use the engine on a rooted phone:

```sh
adb push zig-out/bin/zeptun /data/local/tmp/
adb shell chmod 755 /data/local/tmp/zeptun
adb shell su -c '/data/local/tmp/zeptun probe'
adb shell su -c '/data/local/tmp/zeptun run --tun zeptun0 --socks5 127.0.0.1:1080 --route 1.1.1.1/32'
```

The engine creates the device through `/dev/tun`, installs its rules in the 9000 range, which take precedence over the system rules at 10000 and above, and marks its own upstream sockets with bit 0x200000 so they keep the platform's network selection. Everything is removed when the process stops.

Two details matter on a phone. A proxy running outside the engine needs to bypass the tunnel itself, either through `--exclude-uid` for the user it runs as or through its own socket mark, otherwise its upstream connections are captured and loop. And where the upstream has no IPv6, give the interface only an IPv4 address (`--address 172.19.0.1/30`), so applications do not spend their connect timeout on IPv6 that cannot leave the phone.

## Kotlin

`libzeptun-jni.so` registers its methods on the class `dev.zeptun.Zeptun`. Change `ZEPTUN_JNI_CLASS` in `src/jni/zeptun_jni.c` to use another package or class name.

```kotlin
package dev.zeptun

object Zeptun {
    external fun nativeStart(service: Any?, fd: Int, config: String?): Int
    external fun nativeStop()
    external fun nativeVersion(): String
    external fun nativeCounter(index: Int): Long

    init {
        System.loadLibrary("zeptun-jni")
    }
}
```

```kotlin
class ZeptunService : VpnService() {
    private var descriptor: ParcelFileDescriptor? = null

    override fun onStartCommand(intent: Intent?, flags: Int, startId: Int): Int {
        val builder = Builder()
            .setSession("Zeptun")
            .setMtu(8500)
            .addAddress("172.19.0.1", 30)
            .addRoute("0.0.0.0", 0)
            .addDnsServer("172.19.0.2")
        descriptor = builder.establish() ?: return START_NOT_STICKY

        val config = """
            preset = "mobile"

            [handler]
            kind = "socks5"

            [handler.socks5]
            server = "127.0.0.1:1080"

            [dns]
            hijack = true
        """.trimIndent()

        val rc = Zeptun.nativeStart(this, descriptor!!.fd, config)
        if (rc != 0) stopSelf()
        return START_STICKY
    }

    override fun onRevoke() {
        Zeptun.nativeStop()
        super.onRevoke()
    }

    override fun onDestroy() {
        Zeptun.nativeStop()
        descriptor?.close()
        descriptor = null
        super.onDestroy()
    }
}
```

`nativeStart` takes the descriptor from `VpnService.Builder.establish()` and an optional TOML document; passing `null` starts from the mobile preset. The service object is held as a global reference and its `protect(int)` method is called for every upstream socket, which is what keeps proxy traffic out of the tunnel. `nativeCounter(index)` reads one field of the statistics snapshot, in the order the fields appear in `ZeptunStats` after `version` and `workers`.

The bridge runs the engine on its own thread, so `nativeStart` returns immediately and `nativeStop` joins it.

## Routing without root

The system owns the routes: whatever `VpnService.Builder` is told to include or exclude is what reaches the tunnel. Use `addRoute`, `addDisallowedApplication` and `addAllowedApplication` on the builder, and leave `auto_route` off in the configuration.

## Routing with root

On a rooted device the engine can create `/dev/tun` itself and install policy rules like it does on desktop Linux, including `--include-package` and `--exclude-package`, which resolve app names through `/data/system/packages.list` for every Android user. The mark bit 0x200000 keeps netd's network selection intact.

## Memory

The mobile preset uses a single queue, no offload, the userspace stack, 64 KB windows and a 24 MB memory budget. `[memory] budget_bytes` bounds packet buffers and session tables together, which is the simplest way to keep a VPN service inside the platform's limit.
